              <p class="lead my-5"> <font color="white" size="5">Four interlocking rings symbolised the merger of four automobile manufacturers
                  based in the German state of Saxony: Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer became Auto Union AG.
                  Here are brief details of the roots of today's AUDI AG. The company Wanderer originated as
                  a bicycle repair shop.</font></p>
